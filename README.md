We will post [some issues](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ProjectYulab/issues) here, usually with small coding requirements. 

If you want to participate in our development and receive our guidance, you can get involved by solving these issues. 

If you want to join us (e.g., as a graduate student), getting involved is a great starting point.

PS: Closed issues are usually problems that have already been solved with good solutions, and can be used as learning materials. Of course, if you have a better implementation, please feel free to give us feedback.

我们会在这里发一些issues，通常是一些编程量不会太大的需求。

如果你想参与我们的开发，并得到我们的指导，那么你可以通过解决这些issue来参与。

如果想加入我们（如读研究生），那么参与进来是个很好的开始。

PS: 已经关闭的issues，会是一些已经有比较好解决方案的问题，可以做为学习的资料，当然如果你有更好的实习，欢迎反馈给我们。
